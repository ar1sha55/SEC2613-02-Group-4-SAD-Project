1.0 INTRODUCTION


	A supervisor is necessary for research and dissertations, and acquiring one is an essential for students pursuing a Masters or PhD. This procedure is vital since they require someone with extensive expertise to pass on to their students and a broad range of resources (publications, finances). In order to offer their advice, recommendations, and perspectives to the students under their supervision, a supervisor must also possess considerable academic expertise in their profession.

Nevertheless, the search for a supervisor can be challenging and time-consuming. Students have to make the effort to get in touch with a supervisor, schedule a meeting to discuss the research, and find someone who can effectively communicate with them. It must be tough on them to fit all of this into their demanding postgraduate schedule.

Thus, a postgraduate supervision module is developed as a solution to let them locate a supervisor with merely one click. This module takes the shape of a website that they can visit to get in touch with possible supervisors without wasting time interviewing and screening each one individually. In this phase, we will explain the proposed solutions including feasibility studies and cost benefit analysis, objectives of this module, scope of the project, project planning and lastly the benefit and overall summary of the postgraduate supervision module.
