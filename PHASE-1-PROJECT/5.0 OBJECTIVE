The postgraduate supervision module is developed to serve these objectives:

-> Boost both students’ and supervisor productivity to ensure they are able to deliver a well explained and researched case study.

-> Enhance better communication between students and supervisors to help students having better resources academically and financially.

-> Fuels students’ educational possibilities, for example letting them know where they lack by the FAQ section provided in the website.

-> Gives a chance for every student to be better informed on the availability of supervisors.

-> Better data management, including storing, analyzing, and visualizing data. For instance, data of supervisor’s rating.
