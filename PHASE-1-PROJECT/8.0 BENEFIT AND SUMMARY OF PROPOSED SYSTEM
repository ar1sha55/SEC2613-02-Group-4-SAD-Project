The Postgraduate Supervision Module is a proposed system designed to streamline the supervisor-student matching process and improve the 
postgraduate academic experience overall. We identified a few challenges faced by both students and supervisors in the current manual process, 
including the time-consuming nature of supervisor search and lack of transparent communication during rejection scenarios. Based on these 
findings, we have proposed a system with key features tailored to meet these challenges and achieve our project objectives.

For example, the system makes it simple for students to look for potential supervisors based on attributes like availability and academic 
background. Students can expedite the process and save time by requesting supervision with just one click once a supervisor has been identified. 
Meanwhile, supervisors have access to a simplified interface through which they may oversee supervision requests, review student profiles, and 
offer comments regarding rejections.

Additionally, the systemâ€™s features like calendar appointments, document uploads, and auto-generated messages allow supervisors and students to 
collaborate and communicate easily. This leads to efficient supervision and progress monitoring, which eventually results in the timely completion 
of research milestones.

Furthermore, the system encourages transparency and accountability by requiring supervisors to provide explanations for rejection, enabling students 
to recognize their own areas for improvement. This feedback loop enhances the overall academic experience by promoting a supportive environment for 
student growth and development.

In summary, the Postgraduate Supervision Module uses technology to improve interactions, increase productivity, and encourage teamwork in order to 
completely transform the supervisor-student matching process. The system enables both students and supervisors to maximize their academic experience 
and attain academic achievement by offering an intuitive platform for supervision.
